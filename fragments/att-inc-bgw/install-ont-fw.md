## Install ONT firmware

=== "WAS-110"

    !!! note "Upgrading a pre-flashed 8311 WAS-110"
        If your [WAS-110] came with 8311 firmware pre-installed, you do not need to follow the full installation guide
        below. Instead, you can go directly to the [Supplementary Upgrades] section to re-install the
        [official 8311 community build] to both A and B partitions.

  [official 8311 community build]: https://github.com/djGrrr/8311-was-110-firmware-builder/releases/latest
  [Supplementary Upgrades]: install-the-8311-community-firmware-on-the-was-110.md#supplementary-upgrades

    Although not strictly necessary for AT&T, the 8311 community firmware is highly recommended for masquerading as
    the {{ page.meta.ont }} and used for the remainder of the [WAS-110] sections of this guide.

    There are two (2) methods to install the 8311 community firmware onto the [WAS-110], outlined in the following guides:
