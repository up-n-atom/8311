## Purchase WAS-110/X-ONU-SFPP ONT { #purchase-was-110-x-onu-sfpp-ont }

The [WAS-110] and [X-ONU-SFPP] are available from select resellers worldwide; purchase at your discretion. We assume no
responsibility or liability for the listed resellers.

??? info "Purchase SC/APC variant; if unavailable, add an SC/APC (female) to SC/UPC (male) 0dB attenuator for conversion."
    Bell and most North American ISPs terminate their fiber at the ONT using SC/APC (green) connectors.

    __APC:__ Angled Physical Contact (APC) tips are polished to 8 degrees. This eliminates signal reflections on the
    fiber.

    __Compatibility:__ Never mismatch SC/APC (green) and SC/UPC (blue). This causes signal loss and can
    __permanently damage__ the fiber faces.
