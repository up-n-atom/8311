### WAS-110/X-ONU-SFPP ONT { #purchase-ont }

The [WAS-110] and [X-ONU-SFPP] are available from select resellers worldwide; purchase at your discretion. We assume no
responsibility or liability for the listed resellers.

??? info "Purchase SC/APC variant"
    Although Virgin Media terminate their fiber at the ONT using LC/APC connectors, purchasing an SC/APC ONT guarantees
    portability and compatibility across the pond or channel.

    Angled Physical Contact (APC) tips are polished to 8 degrees. This eliminates signal reflections on the
    fiber.

    __Compatibility:__ Never mismatch APC (green) and UPC (blue). This causes signal loss and can
    __permanently damage__ the fiber faces.
