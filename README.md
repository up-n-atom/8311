<h3 align="center">PON dot Wiki</h3>

A community assisted by professionals and enthusiasts with a common goal of bypassing the ISP CPE using commodity 
hardware.

We're unlocking the FTTP edge with the freedom of choice through shared knowledge and open standards, while empowering 
SOHO operators by kicking the ISP CPE to the curb.

The [wiki](https://pon.wiki) contains guides for masquerading the ISP CPE and/or ONT for greener pastures, and 
inevitably PON-related content!
