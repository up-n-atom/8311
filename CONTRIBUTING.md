## Docs Website

The website's content aims to remain clean and professional. It aids the community with their pon-related needs and helps potential sponsors understand what we are all about!

To create guides or contribute to existing ones, the markdown files are found within the [posts directory](./docs/guides/posts)

Screenshots are created using [Epiphany](https://apps.gnome.org/Epiphany/) at 1920x1080p resolution. With [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp) they are converted to 60% resolution e.g. `cwebp -q 60 screenshot.jpg -o screenshot.webp`. The artwork is created in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and mixed with assets from [@storyset](https://www.freepik.com/author/stories) on Freepik. When it's finished, the artwork is exported as 1280x960p resolution.

## Issues

Issues about errors with the website such as with the content, are welcome. They can also potentially be used for feature requests but especially for general questions, the [Pon Wiki Discord](https://discord.pon.wiki) is a better place for those.
