# 10-Gigabit Symmetrical Passive Optical Network

XGS-PON is a 10-Gigabit passive optical network standard ([ITU-T G.9807.1]) that delivers symmetrical speeds of up to
10 Gbit/s.

It uses distinct wavelengths for downstream (1577 nm) and upstream (1270 nm) transmission, employing Time Division
Multiplexing (TDM) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), respectively.

As the successor to [GPON], it is not backward compatible due to their differing wavelengths. However, this
distinction allows XGS-PON to coexist on the same fiber as [GPON] through wavelength division multiplexing (WDM).
