# Privacy Policy

This policy describes the general practices regarding information processing for this website. Accessing any Content constitutes an acknowledgment of these terms.

## Network Delivery

This website is served via **Cloudflare** and **GitHub Pages**. Data processing is handled by these third-party entities as follows:

* **Network Management:** Cloudflare acts as a proxy to provide security and DDoS protection. Technical metadata (such as IP addresses and request headers) is processed by Cloudflare to maintain the integrity of the connection.
* **Hosting Operations:** GitHub Pages provides the physical hosting. GitHub may collect and store server logs as part of its standard operations to ensure the security of its hosting platform.
* **Access Limitations:** The website Operator does not have access to, nor control over, these network-level logs. Consequently, there is no technical ability to correlate metadata with specific individuals.

## Analytics & Consent

**Google Analytics** is utilized to assess aggregate traffic patterns and improve the Content.

* Data collection for analytics only occurs if the "Accept" option is explicitly selected via the user interface.
* Analytics data is accessed by the website Operator in an aggregate format as provided by the third-party platform.

## Data Subject Rights

This website is a public-facing resource and does not maintain user accounts, profiles, or registration systems. Because there is no intentional correlation between technical metadata and specific identities, **requests for data access, correction, or deletion cannot be fulfilled**, as the necessary identifying data is not held by the website Operator.

Users wishing to exercise privacy rights regarding network-level data must contact the third-party infrastructure providers (GitHub, Cloudflare, or Google) directly.

## External Links & Referrals

The Content may contain links to external resources. **No responsibility is assumed** for the practices, technologies, or accuracy of any external entity. Engagement with third-party sites is governed by their respective policies.
