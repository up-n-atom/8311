# History

In October 2018, a group of Canadian software developers began collaborating on the Bell Canada sub-forum of the
**now-defunct [DSLReports]**. Due to the forum's restrictive policies regarding reverse engineering and its disdain for
"[hacker]" culture, the group migrated to a [Slack] workspace dubbed **"BELLY-UP."**

The community initially focused on the technical "cat-and-mouse" game of rooting Bell Canada’s [Sagemcom]-manufactured
gateways (the Home Hub 3000 and 4000). This mission evolved into developing support for 2.5Gbps network hardware based
on [Broadcom] WarpCore and [Marvell] ARMADA architectures. These efforts enabled users to
**extract the ISP-provided SFP+ GPON ONTs** (such as the [Huawei]  [MA5671A], [Alcatel-Lucent]  [G-010S-P], or [Nokia]
G-010S-A) and use them in their own equipment, effectively bypassing the restrictive ISP gateway.

As interest in the [Broadcom] WarpCore patches surged, the community outgrew [Slack]’s free-tier limitations.
In September 2021, "BELLY-UP" transitioned to [Discord], rebranding as the **[8311 community]**. This move allowed the
group to serve a growing global audience of **"bypass" enthusiasts**, fostering a space where individuals from all
walks of life can collaborate to achieve true networking independence.
