# Group Buys

Group buys are run semi-frequently and will be announced by an event notification.

To participate in an upcoming group buy, you must first unlock the *Bazaar* in the __#Channels & Roles__ channel.

Once unlocked, you will gain access to the __#buy-n-sell__ forum, where the group buy purchase thread exists,
as well as the __#groupbuy-discussions__ channel.

If you do not see any active group buy events, it *may* mean that a group buy is currently closed but has not yet concluded
(e.g. the majority of shipments have not been received) or that it is temporarily unavailable.

Please be patient, as this is a volunteer-driven process.
