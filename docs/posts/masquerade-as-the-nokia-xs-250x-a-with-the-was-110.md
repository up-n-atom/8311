## Purchase a WAS-110 or X-ONU-SFPP

The [WAS-110] and [X-ONU-SFPP] are available from select resellers worldwide. To streamline the process, some resellers
are pre-flashing the 8311 community firmware and highly recommended for the [X-ONU-SFPP]. Purchase at your discretion;
we take no responsibility or liability for the listed resellers.

[WAS-110 Value-Added Resellers](../xgs-pon/ont/bfw-solutions/was-110.md#value-added-resellers)

!!! question "Is the WAS-110 or X-ONU-SFPP a router?"
    The [WAS-110] and [X-ONU-SFPP] are __NOT__ a substitute for a layer 7 router; They are an *ONT*, and their __ONLY__
    function is to convert *Ethernet* to *PON* over fiber medium. Additional hardware and software are required to access
    the Internet.

## Install the 8311 community firmware

As a prerequisite to masquerading as the XS-250X-A, the 8311 community firmware is recommended and required for the
remainder of this guide. If you purchased a pre-flashed [WAS-110] or [X-ONU-SFPP], skip past to the [masquerade setup](#masquerade-setup).

=== "WAS-110"

    There are two methods to install the 8311 community firmware onto the [WAS-110], outlined in the following guides:

    __Method 1: <small>recommended</small></h4>__

    :    [Install the 8311 community firmware on the WAS-110](install-the-8311-community-firmware-on-the-was-110.md)

    __Method 2:__

    :    [WAS-110 multicast upgrade and community firmware recovery](was-110-mulicast-upgrade-and-community-firmware-recovery.md)

=== "X-ONU-SFPP"

    The [X-ONU-SFPP] 8311 community firmware installation requires a two-step process and is more prone to failure and
    bricking.

    !!! warning "This process is not thoroughly documented and can lead to a bricked device"

    __Step 1: Install the Azores bootloader__

    :    Skip past to the solution in the following [issue tracker](../xgs-pon/ont/potron-technology/8311-uboot.md#solution)
         on how to install the Azores bootloader.

    __Step 2: Multicast upgrade__

    :    Follow through the [WAS-110 multicast upgrade and community firmware recovery](was-110-mulicast-upgrade-and-community-firmware-recovery.md)

## Masquerade setup

Additionally, mandatory identifiers are available on the back label of the XS-250X-A, such as ONT P/N, ICS, and CLEI if
present.

??? info "As of version 2.4.0 `https://` is supported and enabled by default"
    All `http://` URLs will redirect to `https://` unless the `8311_https_redirect` environment variable is set to
    0 or false.

3. From the __8311 Configuration__ page, on the __ISP Fixes__ tab, disable __Fix VLANs__ from the drop-down.

4. __Save__ changes and *reboot* from the __System__ menu.

### from the shell

1. Login over secure shell (SSH).

    ``` sh
    ssh root@192.168.11.1
    ```

2. Configure the 8311 U-Boot environment.

    !!! reminder "All attributes below are <ins>mandatory</ins> to achieve O5 operation state"
        <ins>Replace</ins> the __8311_gpon_sn__, __8311_iphost_mac__, and __8311_sw_verA/B__ with
        the provisioned values.


    ``` sh
    fwenv_set -8 gpon_sn ALCL... # (1)!
    fwenv_set -8 equipment_id BVMGJ10BRAXS250XA # (2)!
    fwenv_set -8 hw_ver 3FE48114ABBD01 # (3)!
    fwenv_set -8 cp_hw_ver_sync 1
    fwenv_set -8 sw_verA 3FE47493IJHK03
    fwenv_set -8 sw_verB 3FE47493IJHK03
    fwenv_set -8 -b fw_match '^(3FE47\d{3}[A-Z]{4}\d{2})$'
    fwenv_set -8 override_active A
    fwenv_set -8 override_commit A
    fwenv_set -8 pon_slot 10
    fwenv_set -8 fix_vlans 0
    ```

    1. Serial number or S/N
    2. CLEI + Mnemonic
    3. ONT P/N + ICS

    !!! info "Additional details and variables are described at the original repository [^1]"
        `/usr/sbin/fwenv_set` is a helper script that executes `/usr/sbin/fw_setenv` twice consecutively.

        The WAS-110 functions as an A/B system, requiring the U-Boot environment variables to be set twice, once for each
        environment.

        The `-8` option prefixes the U-Boot environment variable with `8311_`.

3. Verify the 8311 U-boot environment and reboot.

    ``` sh
    fw_printenv | grep ^8311
    reboot
    ```

After rebooting the WAS-110, safely remove the SC/APC cable from the XS-250X-A and connect it to the
WAS-110. If all previous steps were followed correctly, the WAS-110 should operate with O5.1 [PLOAM status].
For troubleshooting, please read the [Troubleshoot connectivity issues with the WAS-110] guide before seeking help on
the [8311 Discord community server].

## Software versions

The following are the last known supported software versions. If the __Firmware Version Match__ attribute is configured
with the correct regular expression, the __Software Version A/B__ attribute(s) will attempt to auto-update to match the
firmware version transferred by the OLT, although this isn't foolproof. Most OLT provisioning systems will attempt to
update the firmware via OMCI upon detecting a mismatch. Note that this transfer can take several minutes due to the
size of the firmware image. These images are stored at `/tmp/upgrade/firmware.img` and can be dumped for analysis.

Please help us by contributing new versions via the [8311 Discord community server] or submitting a
[Pull Request](https://github.com/up-n-atom/8311/pulls) on GitHub.
