# Replace an ADTRAN SDX ONT with the WAS-110 on XGS-PON

<!-- more -->
<!-- nocont -->

This guide outlines how to replace an **ADTRAN SDX621i** ONT on an XGS-PON line using a [WAS-110] module pre-flashed with 8311 firmware.

This has been successfully tested by a user on **Netomnia / YouFibre** in the UK, who received a static IP via DHCP using a cloned MAC and VLAN 911 tagging.

---

## What you need

- A [WAS-110] module, pre-flashed with [8311 firmware](https://github.com/djGrrr/8311-was-110-firmware-builder)
- Your provisioned **PON Serial Number** (from your ISP)
- A router or firewall (e.g. OPNsense) with a VLAN-capable WAN interface (e.g. VLAN 911)
- Optional: ability to clone MAC address (required for static IP from some ISPs)

!!! note "Fiber connector"
    The original ONT in this case was connected using **SC/APC**, which plugged directly into the WAS-110 — no patch cables or adapters were necessary.

---

## Configuration overview

Once the WAS-110 is inserted into an SFP+ port and connected to the fiber socket:

### 1. Access the 8311 web UI

- Assign your computer a static IP (e.g., `192.168.11.3/24`)
- Connect to the module directly or via switch
- Visit: `https://192.168.11.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/8311/config`

|---------------------------|------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| PON Serial Number (ONT ID)| From original ONT            | ✅         | Found on label of ADTRAN device       |
| Equipment ID              | `ADTN`                       | ✅         | Matches expected ID for ADTRAN ONTs   |
| Hardware Version          | `1.2.1b`                     |            |                                       |

| Software Version B        | `3.7.4-2306.5`               | ✅         | Matches A                             |
| MIB File                  | `/etc/mibs/prx300_1U.ini`    | ✅         | Note: use `1U`, not `1V`, for VEIP    |
| MAC Address               | Cloned from original ONT     | ✅         | Required for static IP on some ISPs   |

## Real-world example

A UK-based user successfully replaced their **ADTRAN SDX621i** on **YouFibre (Netomnia)** using a WAS-110 from the [Better Internet Store].

### Observations:

> PLOAM state reached **O5.1 (Associated)**, but no WAN IP was received until:
>
> - `Fix VLANs` was disabled
> - OPNsense was rebooted
>
> The 8311 UI became unreachable after assigning it to the WAN VLAN — a static route attempt was unsuccessful. For ongoing access, it's best to configure the ONT before attaching it to your WAN.

---

## Performance

Reported speeds were slightly improved:

> On a 1 Gbps symmetric connection, speed tests showed a 50 Mbps improvement. More importantly, space was freed in the network cabinet by removing the external ONT.
