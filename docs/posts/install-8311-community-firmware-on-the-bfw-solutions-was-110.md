# Install 8311 community firmware on the BFW Solutions WAS-110

![WAS-110 community](install-8311-community-firmware-on-the-bfw-solutions-was-110/was_110_firmware.webp){ class="nolightbox" }
<!-- more -->
<!-- nocont -->

Out of the box, the [WAS-110] is not fully compatible with varying ISP OLT configurations, with issues ranging from
vendor-specific managed entities to VEIP to IEEE standards such as [802.1X] and [802.1ad]. Due to these
incompatibilities and discovered bugs, a community firmware[^1] has been curated to fix any impeding issues[^2].

  [802.1X]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1X
  [802.1ad]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1ad

## Host setup

Plug the [WAS-110] into a 10-gigabit compatible SFP+ host interface, such as a NIC, media converter, and/or network
switch.

!!! note "Rx loss"
    The [WAS-110] running the default Azores firmware will trigger RX_LOS if the SC/APC fiber cable is unplugged or
    inactive. Some host interfaces will enter a power-saving state, making the [WAS-110] inaccessible.

### Download firmware

The community firmware comes in two (2) variants: *basic* and *bfw*; for the purposes of this guide, we'll focus on
the recommended <ins>basic</ins> firmware, which can be downloaded at:

<https://github.com/djGrrr/8311-was-110-firmware-builder/releases/latest>

As an example, the following command downloads the *basic* firmware into the current users download directory.

=== ":material-microsoft: Windows"

    ``` sh
    curl -L --output-dir %UserProfile%\Downloads -O https://github.com/djGrrr/8311-was-110-firmware-builder/releases/download/v2.6.5/WAS-110_8311_firmware_mod_v2.6.5_basic.exe
    ```

=== ":simple-apple: macOS / :simple-linux: Linux"

    ``` sh
    curl -L --output-dir ~/Downloads -O https://github.com/djGrrr/8311-was-110-firmware-builder/releases/download/v2.6.5/WAS-110_8311_firmware_mod_v2.6.5_basic.7z
    ```

The *basic* firmware is based on a vanilla MaxLinear [OpenWrt] 19.07 build from [Potrontec]. Additionally, it
includes customized luci web interfaces for hassle-free masquerading and the aforementioned fixes. And unlike the *bfw*
variant, it does not include the abysmal BFW patches and cruft.

  [OpenWrt]: https://openwrt.org/
  [Potrontec]: https://www.potrontec.com/

### Extract download

The community firmware upgrade comes bundled as a self-extracting executable (:material-microsoft: Windows only) or a
[7-Zip] archive and includes:

`local-upgrade.img`

:   Used with the Azores [web upgrade] utility.

`local-upgrade.tar`

:   Used with the universal [shell upgrade] command sequence.

  [web upgrade]: #web-ui-upgrade
  [shell upgrade]: #shell-upgrade
  [7-Zip]: https://www.7-zip.org/

To extract the archive to a temporary directory, execute the following command(s):

!!! info "Replace `<version>` with the downloaded version."

=== ":material-microsoft: Windows"

    #### Self-extracting Executable

    Double-click on the exe file in [Windows File Explorer].

    #### 7-zip

    ``` sh
    7z e "-i!local-upgrade.*" %UserProfile%\Downloads\WAS-110_8311_firmware_mod_<version>_basic.7z -o%Temp%\8311
    ```

      [Windows File Explorer]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Explorer

=== ":simple-apple: macOS"

    !!! bug "macOS Archive Utility mangles the extracted `local-upgrade.tar`"

    !!! note "The following commands assume [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is installed"

    ``` sh
    brew install sevenzip
    7zz e '-i!local-upgrade.*' ~/Downloads/WAS-110_8311_firmware_mod_<version>_basic.7z -o/tmp
    ```

=== ":simple-linux: Linux"

    !!! note "The following commands assume [Debian] or derivatives[^3]"

    ``` sh
    sudo apt-get install p7zip-full
    7z e '-i!local-upgrade.*' ~/Downloads/WAS-110_8311_firmware_mod_<version>_basic.7z -o/tmp #(1)!
    ```

### Set a static route

The default IP address of the [WAS-110] is `192.168.11.1/24`. To connect successfully, you must have
a route to this IP.

=== ":simple-ubiquiti: Ubiquiti"

    !!! note "The following instructions were written for a UDM Pro, but might be useful on any Ubiquity device with a WAN SFP port"

    1. Set the SFP port as the WAN interface. This is under **Network**, **Settings**, **Internet**.

    ![Ubiquity WAN](install-8311-community-firmware-on-the-bfw-solutions-was-110/ubiquity_wan_full.webp)

    2. Create a static route pointing at the WAN interface. This is under **Network**, **Settings**, **Routing**, **Static Routes**

    ![Ubiquity Static Route](install-8311-community-firmware-on-the-bfw-solutions-was-110/ubiquity_routes_full.webp)

You should now be able to access the WAS-110 at `192.168.11.1`.

### Set a static IP

The default IP address of the [WAS-110] is `192.168.11.1/24`. To connect successfully, a static IP address must be
assigned to the host interface, such as `192.168.11.2/24`[^4].

    ```

Once rebooted, enjoy the labor of love of the 8311 community. As a first step, it is recommended to perform a
[supplementary upgrade].

!!! note "New SSH host keys will be generated"
    Don't be alarmed when attempting to connect over SSH into the newly installed firmware and the following warning is
    presented:

    ```
    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

    ```

## Web UI upgrade <small>not recommended</small> { #web-ui-upgrade data-toc-label="Web UI upgrade" }

!!! danger "Proceed with caution!"
    The Azores firmware upgrade utility on occasion is known to soft-brick itself. To recover, a host device with
    serial breakout on SFP pins 2 (rx) and 7 (tx) will be required.

    Alternatively, jump to the <ins>safer</ins> [shell upgrade](#shell-upgrade) within this guide.

![WAS-110 login](install-8311-community-firmware-on-the-bfw-solutions-was-110/was_110_login.webp)

1. Within a web browser, navigate to

   and, if asked, input the *admin* [web credentials]{ target="_blank" }.

![WAS-110 firmware upgrade](install-8311-community-firmware-on-the-bfw-solutions-was-110/was_110_upgrade.webp)

!!! danger "50/50 chance of soft-bricking the [WAS-110] if proceeded!"

2. From the __Firmware Upgrade__ page, browse for `local-upgrade.img` from the extracted download, and click
   __Upgrade__.

Patiently wait out the process, 4 to 5 minutes, or until the web session becomes unresponsive.

??? tip "Run a continuous ping"
    To recieve an early indication that the [WAS-110] has completed its upgrade reboot cycle, run a continuous ping:

    === ":material-microsoft: Windows"

        ``` sh
        ping -t 192.168.11.1
        ```

    === ":simple-apple: macOS / :simple-linux: Linux"

        ``` sh
        ping 192.168.11.1
        ```

Once rebooted, enjoy the labor of love of the 8311 community. As a first step, it is recommended to perform a
[supplementary upgrade].

## Supplementary upgrades

### A/B architecture

``` mermaid
block-beta
    block:BOOT
        columns 1
        mtd0("<b>uboot</b>\n/dev/mtd0")
        mtd1("<b>ubootconfigA</b>\n/dev/mtd1")
        mtd2("<b>ubootconfigB</b>\n/dev/mtd2")
    end
    block:UBI("/dev/ubi0")
        columns 2
        block A
            columns 1
            mtd9("<b>kernelA</b>\n/dev/mtd9")
            mtd10("<b>bootcoreA</b>\n/dev/mtd10")
            mtd11("<b>rootfsA</b>\n/dev/mtd11")
        end
        block B
            columns 1
            mtd12("<b>kernelB</b>\n/dev/mtd12")
            mtd13("<b>bootcoreB</b>\n/dev/mtd13")
            mtd14("<b>rootfsB</b>\n/dev/mtd14")
        end
        block:PERSIST:2
            columns 1
            mtd15("<b>ptconf</b>\n/dev/mtd15")
            mtd16("<b>rootsfs_data</b>\n/dev/mtd16")
        end
    end
    classDef transparentBlock fill:transparent,stroke:transparent;
    classDef boldTitle fill:transparent,stroke:transparent,font-weight:bold;
    class BOOT,PERSIST transparentBlock
    class A,B boldTitle
```

The [WAS-110] uses an A/B architecture, which means there are two adjacent firmware images: an active image
(the currently running and firmware) and an inactive image. Either image can be selected as active, and upon upgrade,
the inactive image will be overwritten and become the newly active image after reboot, i.e. committed image.

Furthermore, the OLT has the capability to select the active firmware image, upgrade the inactive image, and reboot
the ONT. It is therefore recommended to install the community firmware on both A and B slots.

### Web UI upgrade <small>safe</small> { #8311-web-ui-upgrade data-toc-label="Web UI upgrade" }

!!! info "Integrity first and foremost"
    The 8311 community firmware re-uses the <ins>safe</ins> shell upgrade logic throughout. Those who prefer the CLI
    may continue to use the [shell upgrade] method going forward.

    Furthermore, the 8311 community firmware includes an up-to-date `dropbear`[^5] build, which does not require the use
    of weak algorithms when using an SSH client, i.e.

    `-oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa`

    can be removed from future command usage.
